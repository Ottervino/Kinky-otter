# Apartment Photoshop Scene – Core Visual Identity

This prompt represents a key character and visual tone for the project.
It is meant to feel personal, lived-in, confident, and slightly chaotic in a controlled way.

This is a reference image prompt, not a final product.
A stylized, comic-inspired man in his mid-30s with a copper-blond and auburn blend fade haircut that catches warm red tones in the light. He has a short, well-groomed beard, trimmed close to the face with clean, defined edges (not full or bushy).

He is seated in an orange leather desk chair, working on a laptop in Adobe Photoshop. He is actively designing graphics for clothing brands, leatherwear, kink goods, and alternative fashion projects.

He is wearing:
- a black muscle string tank top
- blue short shorts with the word “HIMBO” printed in white on the left leg
- no socks and no shoes (barefoot, relaxed at home)

The setting is a small, clean, open-concept one-bedroom apartment with large windows and lots of natural light. The space feels intentional and tidy, but if you look closely there are subtle signs of creative chaos in certain areas (papers, tools, partially finished ideas).

Behind him is a green leather sofa with two solid black leather pillows (no patterns or imagery). Above the sofa hang six framed black-and-white artworks inspired by Tom of Finland–style illustration: bold masculine forms, strong line work, graphic and stylized, suggestive but not explicit.

Somewhere in the apartment is a small raccoon figurine, partially tucked into the scene as a personal detail.

A compact workout bench with two adjustable dumbbells is visible in the background.

A Cricut machine is set up nearby as part of his workflow, along with a cup of coffee on the desk.

The overall tone is:
- confident but soft
- masculine, playful, and self-aware
- queer-coded without being explicit
- creative, lived-in, and personal

The illustration style should be:
- clean and graphic
- stylized rather than realistic
- bold shapes with intentional lines
- suitable for print and sticker adaptation

Notes:
- This image defines the core character and visual tone.
- Use this as a reference when creating future scenes or stickers.
